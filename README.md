# Golf-Putt-Analyzer
We have 2 machine learning computer vision projects we need help with. They are related to golf. Project 1) Stroke Analyzer Tracking the golf putter and start line of the ball. For this project, we are looking at placing a camera phone above the putter to watch the putting stroke. Metrics we would like to record... METRICS * face angle aim at the start (a baseline) * face angle at impact (when ball is hit) * Club Path * Tempo * Arc curvature (point 5” before and after impact) * Impact location on the putter face (toe and heel bias) * Start position bias (toe and heel bias) * Acceleration at impact * Face angle relative to path throughout the stroke * Consistency/std deviation of these measures over a series of 10+ putts Project 2) Outcome measure Tracking the ball and where it goes after a putt is hit. In this scenario, the golfer would place the camera phone some distance away and track the golf ball as players attempt to make putts around one hole. The model must be able to identify the hole. This could be done as a putt rolls into a hole. Perhaps the golfer begins by making a short putt from 2' away as a "calibration" tool for identifying the hole. METRICS * Make/miss percentage of a series of several putts * Length of each putt * Miss of each putt (long/short/left/right) * How the putt is curving (breaking) * Speed of each putt * Slope estimate of putt (based on physics data and how the ball is rolling it should be possible to estimate the slope and speed of the green) We can supply the videos to develop the model. You tell us how many videos we will need and what you expect the accuracy to be like. We can find another upworker to label the videos per your recommendations. The last step will be to put the code into app form for the end user. You'll be working with the app maker to help make this project possible. We are looking for a team player with creative ideas and a background showing success with similar projects. 
--------------------------------
To develop the two machine learning computer vision projects you've outlined for golf putt analysis, we will break down each project into manageable components and outline a roadmap for implementing solutions in Python. We will focus on the key metrics you've identified, utilize computer vision techniques (like object detection and tracking), and eventually deploy the models in a mobile app for end users.
Project 1: Stroke Analyzer

For this project, we are tracking the golf putter and the start line of the ball during a putting stroke. The goal is to analyze the golfer's putting stroke in terms of the metrics you've listed.

Metrics to track:

    Face angle aim at the start – The orientation of the putter at the start of the stroke.
    Face angle at impact – The orientation of the putter at the moment of ball contact.
    Club path – The trajectory of the putter throughout the stroke.
    Tempo – The speed and rhythm of the stroke.
    Arc curvature – The curvature of the putter path 5 inches before and after impact.
    Impact location on the putter face – Identifying where the ball contacts the putter face (toe vs. heel).
    Start position bias – The initial alignment of the putter and how it biases toward the toe or heel.
    Acceleration at impact – Measuring the speed and force of the putter head at the moment of impact.
    Face angle relative to path – How the putter face changes relative to the swing path during the stroke.
    Consistency/std deviation – The consistency of the stroke across multiple putts.

Steps to implement:
1. Preprocessing and Setup

    Camera Setup: A camera (smartphone) positioned above the putter will capture the stroke. Use high-resolution video for better tracking accuracy.
    Object Detection: Detect the putter and ball using object detection methods like YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, or EfficientDet.
    Pose Estimation: Use pose estimation to measure the angle of the putter face at various points (before and after impact).

2. Tracking the Putter and Ball

    Tracking: Use a tracking algorithm like OpenCV's KLT Tracker or Deep SORT to track the movement of the putter and ball.
    Feature Extraction: Calculate the stroke metrics like face angle, arc curvature, and club path by analyzing the video frames.

3. Metric Calculations

    Face angle at start and impact: Use the pose of the putter head relative to the camera to calculate the angle of the clubface at different times.
    Club path: Use the tracked points of the putter head and estimate the curve of the path using polynomials or splines.
    Tempo and acceleration: Analyze the velocity and acceleration of the putter head using optical flow techniques or feature tracking.
    Impact location: Use high-speed cameras and motion blur detection to find the point of contact on the putter face (ball location).

4. Modeling and Evaluation

    Deep Learning Model: Train a model using the labeled data (e.g., images or videos of strokes) to classify the metrics.
    Accuracy Estimation: Based on the availability of labeled data, expect at least 80-90% accuracy for the putter tracking. The model will improve as more labeled data is provided.

5. App Integration

    Mobile App Development: Integrate the model into an app that can process the video inputs. You will likely use a framework like Flutter or React Native for cross-platform compatibility, where the model runs in the backend (using TensorFlow Lite or ONNX for mobile devices).

Project 2: Outcome Measure

This project focuses on analyzing the outcome of the putt, tracking the ball's trajectory and predicting where the ball goes after the stroke. Key metrics include:

Metrics to track:

    Make/miss percentage: Whether the putt is successful or not.
    Putt distance: The distance of each putt and whether it is too short or too long.
    Direction of miss: Whether the miss is left, right, short, or long.
    Putt curvature (breaking): The path the ball follows after hitting the green.
    Speed of the putt: The velocity of the ball when it is hit.
    Slope estimate: The slope of the green inferred from the ball's behavior.

Steps to implement:
1. Preprocessing and Setup

    Ball Detection: Use object detection (YOLOv5 or EfficientDet) to detect the ball in each frame after it is hit.
    Tracking the Ball: Use tracking algorithms like Deep SORT to track the ball's movement after it leaves the putter.
    Identify the Hole: Detect the hole using a combination of computer vision (image segmentation) and possibly initial "calibration" putts to identify hole location.

2. Ball Path and Metrics Calculation

    Putt Path: After the ball is hit, use optical flow or Kalman filters to estimate the trajectory of the ball.
    Ball Speed: Track the speed of the ball based on displacement over time (using frame rate and distance).
    Curvature and Break: Use the curvature of the ball's trajectory to estimate how the ball is breaking based on physics principles (i.e., friction, speed, and slope).
    Slope Estimation: Use a physics-based model to estimate the slope of the green from the curvature and speed of the ball's path.

3. Outcome Metrics

    Make/Miss Prediction: Based on the ball's trajectory, classify whether the ball went into the hole or not.
    Miss Type: Use trajectory analysis to determine if the ball missed left, right, long, or short.
    Final Outcome: Track the ball's final position relative to the hole.

4. Modeling and Evaluation

    Deep Learning Model: Similar to Project 1, you can train a model that takes input from the video frames (with detected ball path) and classifies the outcome (make/miss, miss type, etc.).
    Accuracy Estimation: For this project, the expected accuracy will depend on data volume, but 80%+ accuracy can be expected with a well-trained model.

5. App Integration

    Real-Time Processing: Similar to Project 1, you will integrate the trained model into a mobile app to process live video input and track ball paths and outcomes.
    UI/UX: Build a clean and intuitive user interface where users can see their putt metrics, ball trajectory, and outcome.

Python Code: Example Framework for Stroke Analyzer

Here’s a basic example of how to track the ball and putter using OpenCV and YOLOv5 for object detection:

import cv2
import torch
import numpy as np
from sort import Sort  # Simple online real-time tracking (sort)

# Load YOLOv5 model for detecting golf ball and putter
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')  # Load pre-trained model

# Initialize SORT tracker
tracker = Sort()

# Open video capture (can be replaced with video file)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("putt_video.mp4")

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Perform object detection (for ball and putter)
    results = model(frame)
    detections = results.xywh[0].cpu().numpy()  # [x, y, width, height, confidence]
    
    # Filter results to keep only ball and putter (assuming class IDs for ball and putter)
    detections = detections[(detections[:, -1] == 0) | (detections[:, -1] == 1)]  # Example class IDs

    # Track the detected objects using SORT
    trackers = tracker.update(detections)
    
    # Draw tracking results
    for track in trackers:
        x1, y1, x2, y2, track_id = track
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (int(x1), int(y1)), (int(x2), int(y2)), (255, 0, 0), 2)
        cv2.putText(frame, f"ID: {int(track_id)}", (int(x1), int(y1) - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (255, 255, 255), 2)

    # Show the frame
    cv2.imshow("Putt Analysis", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Conclusion:

For both projects, you will need a combination of object detection, tracking, and pose estimation to extract the desired metrics. Using pre-trained models like YOLOv5 for detection and SORT or Deep SORT for tracking will allow you to track the putter and ball accurately. You will also need deep learning models for outcome prediction (e.g., determining the make/miss percentage and the ball's trajectory). With sufficient labeled data and proper model training, you should be able to achieve high accuracy for both projects.

Finally, integrating the models into a mobile app will make the solution accessible for golfers,
